# Assignment 2
*Summary:* Build a game text-based game in C that generates rooms and randomly connects them 
designating one as a start room and one as an end room. You then proceed to go from room to room until you find the end room and win. 
This project also deals with file I/O. Rooms are written to the disk as separate files and then read back into the program and parsed.
